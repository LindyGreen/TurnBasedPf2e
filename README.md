# PF2e Implementation project.
This is a level 1-3 Pathfinder 2e adventure in a CRPG format.
Currently, most of the combat game mode architecture is complete and requires one month of work to complete. As well as filling in the data tables with abilities and enemies with their stats.
The project implements the Gameplay Ability System for abilities and attributes, but not character building, as that is unnecessary for a 4-6-hour-long role-playing game with pregenerated characters.

Notes:
GitHub doesn't contain the project assets as it's a public repository. That includes some abilities, maps, VFX etc. 
Should be private, but I need a portfolio code example.
